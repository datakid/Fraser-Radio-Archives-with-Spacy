They first of all took up land \\r\\n       grants at the Swan River Settlement, Fremantle in 1829. \\r\\n                   Senator Henty is a direct descendant of Thomas\\r\\n        and Frances Henty, through their son James, who led the \\r\\n        expedition to the new colony.\\r\\n                   Unfortunately, the land grants given to the \\r\\n        brothers fn the colony were of poor grazing quality and \\r\\n        complaints to the Governor, Sir James Stirling, were of\\r\\n        little avail.   LventuallY, in 1831, James Henty decided \\r\\n        to sell up the family holdings and move to Launceston.\\r\\n        He there founded the rterallahtfirm of Henty and Co.
